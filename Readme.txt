This is an android application that I made in my junior year in college.

It is a drumkit simulator with a simple UI. The accelerometer of the android device is used to measure the movement of the phone. Based on the difference between the previous and the next position, using 3 dimensional cartesian coordiantes, each movement is assigned to the sound of a specific drum (Bass, Floor Tom, Hi-hat, Crash, etc.). The senesitivity of the app can be changed by changing the threshold values for a particular direction.

I hope you have fun using this app!
